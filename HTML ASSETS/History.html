            <h1>COMPANY HISTORY</h1>
            <div class="imageSubText">
                <p>This company has a long range of history that has allowed it to fully shape itself into the business it is today. Originating from 19 - -, this business franchise has undergone a hefty amount of experiences which allowed it to make and sell the Ice Buko it makes this day.

        <div class="textDefault">
            <p>The business was established around the 1980’s by the two business pioneers: Mr. Douglas V. Cordova, and his wife, Mrs. Balbina Y. Cordova. They initially created the business from the ground up, having over 5 workers to start with, along with their daughter who would occasionally handle small amounts of work from here on then. Back then, the business wasn’t as fully developed as its current state, and had to perform operations within backrooms. Apart from that, the business only had 3 available flavors (Ube, Chocolate, and Mango) at that time, since it was relatively small.

        <p>Over to the 1990’s to the almost early 2000’s, the business started to progress further. The business had gained over 17 workers, but then got reduced to merely 2 overtime when the rest of the workers had to leave for reasons being. Additionally, the business has undergone a complete operating area renovation way back 2012-2013. This was where most of the equipment has undergone a favorable upgrade in order for the business to progress further. Additionally, the daughter, overtime, has gained more control over the financial and logistic side of the business, ensuring that everything legal and financial related is taken care of.

        <p>Looking at the present year, the business has progressed further and favorably now having over 6 available different flavors as well as overall improvement in the business facility such as better manufacturing equipment, better security device augmentation, and etc. Business has also been operating quite well for it, as people constantly come to purchase packs and bundles of Ice Buko, which result in good revenue. However, it should be noted that this business has been made known purely through word of mouth, and would like to continue to be known through so, as the business isn’t planning on becoming anything too big. Overall, the business has reached a good operating state and is ready to serve our customers with fresh & authentic local desserts!
